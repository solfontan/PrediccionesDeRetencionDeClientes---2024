    "*Los modelos predictivos en el ámbito del machine learning representan una herramienta invaluable para el análisis y la mejora continua de las operaciones empresariales. En particular, en este proyecto centrado en el sector de las tarjetas de crédito, se explorará la aplicación de técnicas predictivas para evaluar la probabilidad de abandono de clientes del banco. A través de la identificación de patrones significativos en los datos, se buscará comprender mejor el comportamiento de los clientes y anticipar posibles acciones de abandono. Posteriormente, se implementarán medidas estratégicas con el fin de mitigar estos riesgos y fomentar la retención de clientes. Este enfoque no solo busca optimizar la rentabilidad del negocio, sino también fortalecer la relación con los clientes al ofrecer soluciones personalizadas y proactivas.*"

    "*Medida elegida: *La precisión* en problemas de modelos supervisados  -  clasificación indica qué tan exacto es un modelo en predecir la clase correcta. Por ejemplo, en la detección de fraudes con tarjetas de crédito, una alta precisión significa que el modelo identifica correctamente la mayoría de las transacciones fraudulentas, evitando así errores costosos. En resumen, optimizar la precisión nos ayuda a mejorar la confiabilidad de nuestras predicciones, lo que es crucial para la seguridad financiera y la satisfacción del cliente.*\n",

    "*Imagina que estás trabajando en un proyecto para predecir si un cliente abandonará un banco. La precisión en este caso sería la medida de cuántos de los clientes que el modelo predice que van a abandonar realmente lo hacen. Por ejemplo, si el modelo predice que 100 clientes abandonarán el banco y 85 de ellos realmente lo hacen, la precisión sería del 85%. Una alta precisión aquí significa que el banco puede identificar con confianza a la mayoría de los clientes propensos a abandonarlo, permitiéndoles tomar medidas proactivas para retenerlos y optimizar recursos.*"

    "La mayoría de nuestros datos se ajustan adecuadamente según la media obtenida mediante la validación cruzada. Esta técnica implica dividir el conjunto de datos en múltiples subconjuntos, alternando entre ellos para entrenar y evaluar el modelo. La media de las métricas de rendimiento proporciona una evaluación más robusta del modelo, ya que no depende de una sola división de los datos. Es importante recordar que los valores en el conjunto de datos son aproximados y redondeados, lo que facilita la aplicación de modelos y la selección de los más adecuados.\n",
    "\n",
    "La validación cruzada es esencial para evaluar la capacidad de generalización de un modelo. Consiste en dividir el conjunto de datos en k subconjuntos (llamados \"folds\"), donde uno de los subconjuntos se reserva como conjunto de prueba y los restantes se utilizan como conjunto de entrenamiento. Este proceso se repite k veces, de manera que cada subconjunto se utilice como conjunto de prueba exactamente una vez. Finalmente, se promedian los resultados de evaluación para obtener una estimación más precisa del rendimiento del modelo en datos no vistos. Esto ayuda a evitar el sobreajuste al evaluar el modelo en diferentes conjuntos de datos y garantiza una evaluación más robusta de su capacidad de generalización.\n",

Es evidente que existe margen para mejorar especialmente la precisión en las características del uno, que actualmente se sitúa en un 66%. Nuestro objetivo es alcanzar un nivel de precisión del 90% o incluso del 94%, lo que nos impulsará hacia una mayor confiabilidad en las predicciones y una toma de decisiones más efectiva.

A diferencia de la mayoría de los modelos, que requieren la conversión de variables categóricas a numéricas, el CatBoost puede trabajar directamente con ellas, lo que simplifica significativamente el proceso de modelado. En el caso de nuestro baseline, hemos observado que el CatBoost proporciona resultados satisfactorios incluso cuando se utiliza con variables numéricas, lo que nos motiva a explorar su desempeño sin necesidad de procesar las características previamente. Esta decisión nos permitirá aprovechar al máximo las capacidades inherentes del CatBoost y potencialmente mejorar la eficacia de nuestro modelo."

El PCA (Análisis de Componentes Principales) es una técnica común de reducción de dimensionalidad que identifica las combinaciones lineales de características que capturan la mayor parte de la variabilidad en los datos. Esto permite conservar la información importante mientras se reduce el número de características, lo que facilita la visualización, la interpretación y el procesamiento de los datos, especialmente en conjuntos de datos de alta dimensión."
